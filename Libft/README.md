# 📚 Libft

I achieved **125%** on Intra with this version of **Libft**! 🚀

## 💡 Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by [IanToujou's Libft](https://github.com/IanToujou/School-42/tree/master/Core/LibFT). I adapted some concepts from his work to enhance my implementation. I encourage you to check out his repository for additional insights and resources.

## 🛠️ Testing Instructions

For testing, I used [SLDDL's Normino](https://github.com/SLDDL/Normino), a convenient, no-installation-required tester. Follow these steps to set up and run the tests:

### 1️⃣ **Ensure Your Project Compiles**

   Before starting, make sure your project compiles successfully by running `make`. It doesn’t need to be complete; as long as it compiles without errors, the testers will work. ✅

### 2️⃣ **Run Normino**

   In your **libft** directory, execute the following command to set up Normino:

   ```bash
   curl smasse.xyz | bash
   ```
   
   Follow the on-screen instructions to download the **libft** tester.

### 3️⃣ **Add Dynamic Library Compilation Rule to Your Makefile**

   Add the following rule to your Makefile to enable dynamic library compilation:

   ```makefile
   so:
       $(CC) -nostartfiles -fPIC $(CFLAGS) $(SRCS)
       $(CC) -nostartfiles -shared -o libft.so $(OBJS) $(BONUS_OBJS)
   ```

   🔍 **Tip**: The values inside `$(...)` may vary depending on your Makefile configuration. Update these values according to your setup.

### 4️⃣ **Clean Up Before Running Tests**

   Run `make fclean` and delete any existing `libft.so` file before each test run to avoid conflicts. 🧹

### 5️⃣ **Run Testers**

   Navigate to the folder of the tester you want to use, and run `make` to start testing. Make sure to redo **Step 4** before each test run for best results.

### 6️⃣ **Cleanup After Testing**

   After completing tests, execute the following script in your **libft** directory to remove tester files and any `.o` files:

   ```bash
   bash removetests.sh
   ```

   🗑️ **Extra Cleanup**: Also delete the `a.out` file generated by the testers. Always double-check that your repository has no extra files before submitting your project to keep everything clean and organized.
