# Printf Project

I achieved **125%** with this version of **Printf (Printf_With_Bonus)**! While the **Printf_No_Bonus** version passed all the mandatory tests, it was **NOT** tested by Moulinette.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by [IanToujou's Printf](https://github.com/IanToujou/School-42/tree/master/Core/PrintF). I adapted some concepts from his work to enhance my own implementation. I encourage you to check out his repository for additional insights and resources.

## Testers

For testing, I used [SLDDL's Normino](https://github.com/SLDDL/Normino). The best part is that no installation is required! To use it, simply run the following command:

```bash
curl smasse.xyz | bash
```
